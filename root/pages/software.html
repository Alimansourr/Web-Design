    Tesla has updated the Model S and Model X with a new motorized swivel
    function for the center screen. The feature enables a better viewing
    experience in the car as the automaker is betting on more in-car
    entertainment.<br />
    Over the last few years, Tesla has been putting a lot of efforts into
    entertainment inside its vehicles. From Tesla Theater for streaming
    services to video games, there have been a lot of software updates to
    bring new features to entertain inside its electric vehicles.<br />
    The automaker is even doing some hardware design around entertainment.
    That has become evident with the refreshed Model S and Model X. Tesla's
    two flagship vehicles got a new large horizontal center display that is
    better suited for watching videos and a new backseat display powered by a
    gaming computer.

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Traffic-Aware Cruise Control</h2>
    <br />
    To engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control in Model S and Model X, pull down
    once on the cruise control stalk on the left of the steering column. In
    Model 3 and Model Y, pull down once on the gear selector stalk on the
    right of the steering column.<br /><br />
    <h2>Autosteer</h2>
    <br />
    To engage Autosteer in Model S and Model X, pull towards you twice on the
    cruise control stalk on the left of the steering column. In Model 3 and
    Model Y, pull down twice on the gear selector stalk on the right of the
    steering column. A grey steering wheel icon will appear on your display,
    next to the speedometer, when the system is available to engage. A blue
    steering wheel icon will appear on your display, next to the speedometer,
    when Autosteer is engaged.<br />
    When Autosteer is in use, it measures the amount of torque that you apply
    to the steering wheel and, if insufficient torque is applied, an
    escalating series of audible and visual alerts again reminds you to place
    your hands on the wheel. This helps ensure you are attentive and trains
    good driving habits. If you repeatedly ignore these warnings, then you
    will be locked out from using Autopilot for the duration of that trip.<br /><br />
    <h2>Navigate on Autopilot</h2>
    <br />
    Navigate on Autopilot is designed to get you to your destination more
    efficiently by actively guiding your car from on-ramp to off-ramp,
    including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway
    interchanges, and taking exits. It's designed to make finding and
    following the most efficient path to your destination even easier on the
    highway when Autopilot is in use.<br />
    To engage this feature, you must first enable Autosteer by going to
    Controls Autopilot Autosteer - then enable the Navigate on Autopilot
    feature. Camera calibration will be required and the latest version of
    Navigation maps must be downloaded via Wi-Fi.<br />
    For each route where Navigate on Autopilot is available, you will have the
    option to activate it by pressing the NAVIGATE ON AUTOPILOT button located
    in your Navigation Turn List. You can also activate Navigate on Autopilot
    automatically any time a destination is entered and Autopilot is engaged
    by adjusting your Navigate on Autopilot settings from Controls Autopilot
    Customize Navigate on Autopilot.<br />
    On Model 3 and Model Y, Navigate on Autopilot can be engaged on most
    highways by moving the gear lever twice downwards, in quick succession. On
    Model S and Model X built between 2012-2021, Navigate on Autopilot can be
    engaged on most highways by pulling the cruise stalk toward you, twice in
    quick succession.<br /><br />
    <h2>Auto Lane Change</h2>
    <br />
    To initiate an automated lane change, you must first enable Auto Lane
    Changes through the Autopilot Controls menu within the Settings tab. Then
    when the car is in Autosteer, a driver must engage the turn signal in the
    direction that they would like to move. In some markets depending on local
    regulations, lane change confirmation can be turned off by accessing
    Controls Autopilot Customize Navigate on Autopilot and toggle 'Lane Change
    Confirmation' off.<br /><br />
    <h2>Autopark</h2>
    <br />
    If your car sees a parking spot, a grey 'P' icon will appear on the left
    or right hand side of your instrument panel, depending on the location of
    the space. Autopark detects parallel parking locations when driving below
    15mph and perpendicular parking locations when driving below 10mph. To use
    Autopark at that time, press on the brake and shift the gear selector into
    'Reverse.' Keep your foot on the brake. 'Start Autopark' will appear in
    blue text on your touchscreen - press this to start the feature and
    release the brake and steering wheel. Autopark will then begin to maneuver
    the vehicle into the parking space by controlling your cars speed, gear
    changes and steering angle, but you should remember to be alert and
    monitor the backup camera view to check for obstacles.<br />
    Once Autopark is complete, the car will let you know it is complete and
    shift into 'Park.' You can override Autopark at any time by taking control
    of the steering wheel.<br /><br />
    <h2>Summon</h2>
    <br />
    To use Summon, open the Tesla app. Press Summon and then press the forward
    or reverse buttons. Model S and Model X owners can use Summon with their
    key fob by holding the center of the key fob for three seconds until the
    car's hazard lights come on, and then pressing either the frunk or trunk
    button on key fob to Summon forwards and backwards respectively. Summon
    also integrates with HomeLink and will open your garage door to pull your
    car out of the garage.<br /><br />
    <h2>Smart Summon</h2>
    <br />
    Smart Summon is designed to allow your car to drive to you or a location
    of your choosing, maneuvering around and stopping for objects as
    necessary. Like Summon, Smart Summon is only intended for use in private
    parking lots and driveways. You are still responsible for your car and
    must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line
    of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful
    around quick moving people, bicycles and cars.<br />
    To use Smart Summon, open your Tesla app, tap Summon and then select the
    Smart Summon icon. To activate the feature, press and hold the COME TO ME
    button. Alternatively, tap the target icon, set the target destination of
    your choice by adjusting the map, and then press and hold the GO TO TARGET
    button. You can stop your car from driving at any time by releasing the
    button.<br />
    Smart Summon works with your Tesla app and your phone's GPS to operate.
    You must be within approximately 200 feet of your car to use. Smart Summon
    requires the latest version of the Tesla mobile app (3.10.0 or later).
    Please refer to the Owner's Manual for additional details about this
    feature.<br />
